# Ingredient specification extraction

Goal: drop a supplier's raw material specification into
`OneDrive - Wasabi\...\FMS System\3. Supporting Docs\Ingredient Specs`, and have its nutrition
and allergen data matched to the live NutriCost ingredient by **code** and written straight into
the database — no manual re-typing, and the source document itself is never stored on the site
(only the matched values persist, on the ingredient row that already exists).

**Status: methodology documented, matching verified against a real spec. The write pipeline
(actually calling `PUT /api/ingredients/{id}`) is not built yet** — this file exists so the
extraction rules are nailed down and repeatable before any code writes to production data.

## Matching rule: exact code, never fuzzy

The spec's own "Product Code" field is matched **exactly** against `ingredient.code` in
NutriCost. No name-based fuzzy matching — see the reasoning that led here: name matching risks
picking the wrong ingredient silently, while an exact code match is unambiguous or fails loudly
(code not found → flag it, never guess or create a new ingredient).

**Real example, verified against the live site:**
- Spec file: `107168 (P00018) Black Bean Paste RM Spec V3 (06.02.25).xlsx`
- Spec's own "Product Code" cell (`3 Ingredient & Recipe`!C4, and repeated on every section
  sheet): `"107168 (P00018)"` — two codes in one cell, a NutriCost code (`107168`) and what
  looks like a project/P-code (`P00018`)
- Matched in the live system: `107168` → **"RM Black Bean Paste"** (confirmed via
  `GET /api/ingredients`, cost £3.69564, currently `kcal: 0` — no nutrition entered yet)
- **Extraction rule:** when the Product Code cell contains a parenthetical, use the part
  *before* the parenthesis as the match code — that's the one that's an actual NutriCost
  ingredient code. If a bare code with no parenthetical doesn't match anything, try any
  parenthetical portion as a fallback before giving up.

## Source template structure

Every spec seen so far uses the same standard multi-tab "Raw Material Specification" template
(`Doc Ref: TECH-PROCESS-19`). Sheet names and purpose:

| Sheet | Contains |
|---|---|
| `1&2 Manufacturer Detail` | Supplier/manufacturer info — not extracted |
| `1bFarm&Processing Plants-Salmon` | Only relevant for fish/seafood products |
| `3 Ingredient & Recipe` | Product name, product code, sub-ingredient breakdown — **product code source** |
| `4 Packaging Detail` | Not extracted |
| `5&6 Durability & Micro Standard` | Shelf life/microbiological — not extracted |
| `7 Nutrition Information` | **Nutrition values — primary extraction target** |
| `8&9 Intolerance & Dietary` | **Allergens + vegetarian/vegan — primary extraction target** |
| `10&11 Additive & GMO` | Not extracted (could be a future field) |
| `12 Process Flow` | Not extracted |
| `13&14 Chem & Physical Std` | Not extracted |
| `15&16&17 Meat & Fish & Veg` | Not extracted |
| `18 Palm & derivatives` | Not extracted |
| `Document control & sign off` | Version/issue metadata — not extracted |

Every sheet repeats the same header block at the top (`Product Name :` in `A3`/name in `C3`,
`Product Code :` in `A4`/code in `C4`) — a cheap sanity check that every sheet in the file
agrees on which product it's for before trusting any of them.

## Field mapping: spec → NutriCost ingredient

### Nutrition (`7 Nutrition Information` sheet, "Per 100g" column — always column C)

| Spec label (column A) | Cell | NutriCost field | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Energy (KJ)*` | C12 | `kj` | |
| `Energy (Kcal)*` | C14 | `kcal` | |
| `Fat (g)*` | C16 | `fat` | |
| `*of which saturate fat (g)*` | C22 | `sat` | Skip the polyunsaturate/monounsaturate rows (C18/C20) — NutriCost only tracks total saturates |
| `Carbohydrate (g)*` | C24 | `carb` | |
| `*of which sugar (g)*` | C26 | `sugar` | |
| `Protein (g)*` | C30 | `protein` | |
| `Fiber (g)*` | C32 | `fibre` | |
| `Salt (g)*` | C36 | `salt` | Use this directly — don't derive salt from sodium (C34); the sheet gives both, salt is what NutriCost stores |

**Always confirm the column is "Per 100g" (header row 9) before reading** — some specs may have
data entered in the "per pack/serving" column (E) instead, or in a differently-shaped table.
Row numbers above are from this template version; verify against row 9's headers first, don't
assume fixed row numbers hold across every spec revision.

**Sanity check before writing:** `kcal ≈ 4×protein + 4×carb + 9×fat` (within ~10%, since fibre
and rounding affect this). Flag, don't silently write, if a spec's own internal numbers fail
this check — that's a source-data error, not something to encode into NutriCost.

### Allergens (`8&9 Intolerance & Dietary` sheet)

The spec checks 20+ categories the EU 14 allergen list doesn't map to 1:1 — several spec rows
collapse into one NutriCost allergen, and several spec rows (Vegetable, Fruit, Animal, Yeast,
Maize, Cocoa, Alcohol, Gluten-level, dietary suitability) aren't EU allergens at all and are not
extracted as allergens.

A row counts as present when its "Product contains?" column (column E) is `Y`.

| Spec row(s) | NutriCost allergen (`Allergens` list, must match `data.js`'s `EU_ALLERGENS` exactly) |
|---|---|
| `Wheat`, `Oat`, `Rye`, `Spelt`, `Barley`, or `Gluten level (more than 20ppm?)` = Y | `Cereals containing gluten` |
| `Crustaceans/crustaceans derivatives` | `Crustaceans` |
| `Egg/egg derivatives` | `Eggs` |
| `Fish/fish derivatives` | `Fish` |
| `Lupin/lupin derivatives` | `Lupin` |
| `Milk/milk derivatives` | `Milk` |
| `Molluscs/molluscs derivatives` | `Molluscs` |
| `Mustard/mustard derivatives` | `Mustard` |
| `Nut/Nut derivatives` | `Nuts` |
| `Peanut/Peanut derivatives` | `Peanuts` |
| `Sesame seeds/sesame seeds derivatives` | `Sesame` |
| `Soya/soya derivatives` | `Soya` |
| `Sulphites or sulphur dioxide... (more than 10ppm?)` | `Sulphur dioxide` |
| `Celery/celery derivatives` | `Celery` |

**Real example (Black Bean Paste):** spec shows `Y` for Vegetable, Seed, Yeast, Soya, and Maize
rows. Of those, only **Soya** is an EU allergen — the rest (vegetable/seed/yeast/maize) are not
extracted. So this ingredient's `Allergens` should be set to `["Soya"]`, nothing else.

**FVN checkbox:** NutriCost's `Fvn` (Fruit/Vegetable/Nut, for HFSS) isn't directly answered by
this spec's Vegetable/Fruit rows — those track ingredient composition for allergen/cross-contact
purposes, not whether the product itself counts as fruit/veg/nut for HFSS scoring. Don't set
`Fvn` from this spec; leave it to whoever reviews the extraction.

## Write workflow (not yet built)

Per the earlier discussion on reliability: **propose, don't auto-write.**

1. Read the spec, extract product code + nutrition + allergens as above.
2. Look up the code in `GET /api/ingredients`. Not found → stop, flag it, don't guess.
3. Show a before/after diff against the matched ingredient's current values (cost is never
   touched by this — specs don't carry cost, only nutrition/allergens).
4. On confirmation, `PUT /api/ingredients/{id}` with only the changed fields — everything else
   on the record (cost, supplier, code, etc.) stays exactly as it was.
5. The existing ingredient version-history mechanism (`ingredient_versions` table, already
   built) captures the before/after automatically as part of that save — no separate audit
   trail needs building.
6. The source `.xlsx` itself is never uploaded, stored, or referenced by the server — it stays
   in the OneDrive folder, read once at extraction time.

## Extraction log

Append an entry each time a spec is actually processed (once the write pipeline exists) —
mirrors `ACCURACY-SCAN.md`'s results-log pattern.

### 2026-09-28 — methodology only, no write performed

- Inspected `107168 (P00018) Black Bean Paste RM Spec V3 (06.02.25).xlsx` (the only file in the
  folder currently) to derive the field mapping and matching rule above.
- Matched code `107168` → `RM Black Bean Paste` in the live system, confirmed via API.
- Did not write anything — this run was purely to establish the methodology in this file before
  any code touches production ingredient data.
